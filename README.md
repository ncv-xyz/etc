This repo is a random assortment of files/patches for LARBS that I don't want
to commit to my fork.

## Current contents:

- `proxy-profile` -- Profile networking for Tor and I2Pd.
  - Append to `~/.config/shell/profile`
- `proxy-aliases` -- Aliases for Tor and I2Pd.
  - Append to `~/.config/shell/aliasrc`
- `vimling.patch` -- Patches init.vim with [vimling](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/vimling).
  - Run `patch -p1 < vimling.patch`.
